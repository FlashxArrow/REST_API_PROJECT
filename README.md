# REST_API_PROJECT

  The purpose of this project was to learn what is an REST API and how do you implement it in your webiste.

  They are millions of REST APIs that are available to us, some are easier to implement, some are harder to implement. The point is to work with mutiple APIs to catch
a pattern and get the experience to understand much quicker how to establish a connection 

  For this project I chosed 3 REST APIs to use:
  
  1.Random Quote Generator (easy difficulty to implement)
  
  2.Covid-19 Stats for different countries (medium difficulty to implement)
  
  3.Game Database Search (hard difficulty to implement)
  
  I used RapidAPI site(https://rapidapi.com) because it automatically generates the "key"(token) and the "host"(client) that every user needs to have in order to use any
  API.
